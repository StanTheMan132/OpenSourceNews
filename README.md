# Open source news
Open source is a news website made to educate the public without bias. The idea is that people can write news articles
and other can edit this, think google docs suggestions, in order to fact check and remove bias. This project is still in the design fase.
If you want to help remove bias and 'fake news' and combat large news site's like fox and cnn try get involved! We'd be happy to have you
along for the ride!
